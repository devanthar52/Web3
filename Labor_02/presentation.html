# Node.js - Inheritance

* We have already seen prototypal inheritance
* However, Node includes its own convenience mechanism for inheritance
* For future reference: It is similar to `_.extend`, but Node does not depend on `_` (Underscore)

<pre class='syntax javascript'>
'use strict';
const
  events = require('events'),
  util = require('util'),
  // event client constructor
  EventsClient = function() {
    events.EventEmitter.call(this);
  };
util.inherits(EventsClient, events.EventEmitter);

const client = new EventsClient();
client.on("myEvent", function() {
  console.log("myEvent triggered");
})
client.emit("myEvent");
</pre>
### example_code/inheritance/inheritance_with_node.js

* Calling the `EventEmitter` constructor in the EventsClient constructor is roughly equivalent to calling `super()` in classical OOP
* Calling `util.inherits()` makes EventsClients' prototypal parent object the EventEmitter prototype

# Node.js - Modules

* One of the biggest problems in JS are naming collisions
* Say you have included a datepicker and a day-by-day schedule
 * Both could define a `drawCalendar()` function
 * If the names are declared in the global namespace at least one program breaks
* Remember: This is why jQuery has its `$` namespace
* Node has a generic solution to this problem called *Modules*

---

# Node.js - Modules

* Node modules follow the *Module Design Pattern*
* The pattern was originally defined as a way to provide both private and
public encapsulation for classes
* In JS, it is used to emulate the concept of classes - providing
public/private methods and variables inside a single object
* Read more about the Module Design Pattern in [Essential JS Design Patterns by Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript)

---

# Node.js - Modules

* A module is just a JS file
* However, this file is evaluated in a special way
* When Node loads the file, it creates a new scope, so the previous datepicker
could not mess with the scheduler plugin
* From inside the plugin, the outside world is invisible
 * Except for requiring other modules
* As a result, your code is properly scoped - no collisions possible

---

# Node.js - Modules

* Exposing _public_ methods or variables is done by scoping them under
`exports`

### Example module
<pre class='syntax javascript'>
f1 = function() {
  console.log("this is a private function and cannot be called outside this module");
}

// public_f1 exposes the otherwise private function f1
exports.public_f1 = f1;

</pre>

### Example application
<pre class='syntax javascript'>
var sample = require('./sample_module');

// this call would fail with: TypeError: Object #&lt;Object&gt; has no method 'f1'
// sample.f1();

// this call will work
sample.public_f1();
</pre>

---

# Node.js - Modules

* Using parts of modules is done similarly
* But saving only a reference to a member of the returned exports object

<pre class='syntax javascript'>
var public_f1 = require("./sample_module").public_f1;

public_f1();
</pre>

* This might save you some typing

# Faye - Robust Messaging Services

* We're going to explore how to write robust messaging services in Node
* We are saving you the low-level capabilities of Node
  * If interested, read up on Node and sockets in Chapter 3 of NTRW (see resources)
* As messaging service, the cross-platform library [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/) will be used
* We have heard about Faye in Web2 when discussing Websockets
* Faye is a publish-subscribe messaging system based on the Bayeux protocol
 * It provides
     * Message servers for Node.js and Ruby
     * And clients for use on the server and in all major web browsers

---

# Faye - PubSub Pattern

* PubSub is a messaging pattern where senders of messages are called *publishers*
* These messages are not programmed to be sent directly to receivers, called
  *subscribers*
* Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge
  of what, if any, subscribers there may be
* Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes
* They only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what,
  if any, publishers are there

---

# Faye - PubSub Pattern

* The largest benefit of using pub/sub is the ability to break down the app
  into smaller, more loosely coupled modules
* It encourages to think about relationships between parts of the app
  * Identifying what layers need to observe or listen for behaviour
  * And which need to push notifications regarding behaviour occurring in other
    parts of our apps
* It is good for designing decoupled systems and are an important tool in the
  JS toolbelt

---

# Faye - PubSub Pattern

* PubSub is structured as an Event Bus as follows

![](images/pubsub_pattern.jpg)

---

# Faye - First example

* Faye is not your usual messaging system in that it provides backend *and*
  frontend clients
* Making it very easy to use PubSub
* Also it takes good care of as a transport layer
* It uses the best mechanism available to your browser, in the order of

  1. Websockets
  1. Long-Polling via HTTP Post (XHR)
  1. Cross Origin Resource Sharing ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS))
  1. Callback-polling ([JSONP](http://www.sitepoint.com/jsonp-examples/))

---

# Faye - First example

## Server Side

1. Install Faye: `npm install faye`
1. Start a server

<pre class='syntax javascript'>
var http = require('http'),
    faye = require('faye');

var server = http.createServer(),
    bayeux = new faye.NodeAdapter({mount: '/'});

bayeux.attach(server);
server.listen(8000);
</pre>
`example_code/faye/first_example/backend/server.js`

---

# Faye - First example
## Client Side

* Subscribing to a channel is easy
<pre class='syntax javascript'>
var client = new Faye.Client('http://localhost:8000/');

client.subscribe('/messages', function(message) {
  alert('Got a message: ' + message.text);
});
</pre>
* Notice how nobody is sending to "/messages" as of now
* Whence somebody is sending, however, all is in place already

<pre class='syntax javascript'>
client.publish('/messages', {
  text: 'Hello world'
});
</pre>

# Faye - Chat Application

* This is an example running the very same server as above
* There's just a tiny bit of CSS and jQuery going on to be able to send different messages

![](images/faye_chat.jpg)

---

# Faye - Chat Application

* Notice that there are three browsers open
* Each has registered a different username
* The two upper browser windows seem to have been open first (see chat text)
 * So they were able to send and retrieve messages
* The browser on the bottom opened the app later
 * However, when the third user writes, all existing users can read the message
* Hence, in very little code, we have a 'complete' asynchronous chat client and server
